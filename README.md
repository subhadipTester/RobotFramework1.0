# Robot Automation Framework

## Overview
This is a flexible and scalable automation framework built using the Robot Framework. It provides a structured approach to automate testing, making it easy to write and maintain test cases for various applications and systems.

## Features
- **Modular Design**: The framework follows a modular architecture, allowing easy addition or removal of test modules.
- **Keyword-Driven Testing**: Utilizes keyword-driven testing approach, enabling testers to write tests in a human-readable format.
- **Reusable Components**: Encourages the creation of reusable test libraries and components for efficient testing.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Capable of running tests across different platforms and environments.
- **Parallel Execution**: Supports parallel execution of test cases, reducing overall test execution time.
- **Reporting**: Generates comprehensive test reports with detailed insights into test execution results.

## Getting Started
1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python and pip installed on your system.
2. **Installation**: Clone the repository and install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. **Configuration**: Modify the configuration files (if required) to suit your testing environment.
4. **Writing Tests**: Create test cases using the Robot Framework syntax in `.robot` files.
5. **Executing Tests**: Execute tests using the `robot` command-line tool, specifying the test suite or individual test cases.
6. **Viewing Reports**: After test execution, view the generated test reports for insights into test results.

## Directory Structure
- **/tests**: Contains test suites and test cases written in the Robot Framework syntax.
- **/keywords**: Houses reusable test libraries and custom keywords.
- **/config**: Configuration files for different environments or setups.
- **/reports**: Generated test reports are stored in this directory.
- **/resources**: Additional resources such as test data, images, etc., can be placed here.
